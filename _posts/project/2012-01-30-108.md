<b>108 Heroes (水浒英雄传)</b> is an Adobe Flash ARPG game I made when I was a freshman. The code is in outdated AS 2,
and is very ugly. But the game itself is fun. As a fan of Water Margin (水浒传), I brought all the 108 heroes into the
game. Each of them has an appearance(only finish drawing about 50% of them, haha) and a different weapon. Players
will recruit other heroes, buy gangs and horses, and fight with other factions to capture more mountain camps.
