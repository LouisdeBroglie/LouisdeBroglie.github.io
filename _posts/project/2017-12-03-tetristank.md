A Ludum Dare 40 Compo game made in 48 hrs. 

A Composition of Tetris + Besiege + Tower defense. 

<!--more-->

Build your very custom blocky chariot to defend, but try to keep balance! Sometimes the more you have, the worse it is! But don’t let the enemy pass through. The more the worse doesn’t mean the less the better! ( You don’t have to put every tetris on your tank if that doesn’t fit well )
