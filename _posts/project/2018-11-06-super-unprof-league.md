A Jekyll based static site generator for website of a unprofessional league. Features include: Squad, matches, news, tables, etc. I put the league inside the school of my undergrad university as a demo. It is actually low-level game but I somehow enjoy displaying it this way and recalling all those memory from a young age lol.
