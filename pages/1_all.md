Hey! I'm Zhangliuyi. LouisdeBroglie / LD. 

I'm a mediocre programmer. But I still try to make something before I die.

I'm now working as a distributed storage database engineer for my fulltime job (to learn, and to prevent from starving), and keep making progress during sparetime on realtime processing and blockchain development.

If daydreaming could work, I hope I could find a girl doing 2D/3D artwork and start a studio as a couple. Like those who made Mount N Blade, Temple Run, etc. (Though very unlikely)



* **Programming:** JAVA stadard, Spring boot related, python, ACM
